## How to run our Dashboard
- Navigate to the `frontend` folder in Terminal, then
- `npm install`
- (These next 2 steps will be handled by a script later on. They are necessary because of a bug in the sveltestrap UI framework.)
  - Go to `src/frontend/node_module/@popperjs/`
  - Open `package.json` and append after line 4 ('description'): `  "type": "module",`
- `npm run dev`
- Enjoy :)


## Existing Code Fragments

- For our dashboard we made use of this template (https://github.com/GeekyAnts/sb-admin-svelte)
  - We rewrote most of the code but copied some pieces that we liked a lot about the template
- We also use Bootstrap CSS for styling and Icons

## Utilized Libraries

# Project Log
## November 2022

- Nico rented a server and set up elasticsearch and kibana on it.
- Nico continued with setting up a website based on svelte that was able to display the current rule we use to scrape Tweets as well as the latest 50 tweets that were harvested from Twitter.
- Raphael and Bastian focused on the first assignment during that timeframe.

## December 2022

- After our first meeting with our supervisor, we decided to each take on work for the upcoming assignments to contribute more equally to the project.
- We brainstormed ideas to implement such that each person will contribute something for the milestone.
- In the first two weeks of december we will implement some kind of text analytics tasks so that we will have a preview that we can show at our 'milestone' meeting mid December.
- Bastian changed the UI of the frontend from materials UI to sveltestrap. He also added the ability to create graphs/diagrams/etc. using the `chart.js` library.
