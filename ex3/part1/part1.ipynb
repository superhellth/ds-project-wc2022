    "An example for that would be 'iban/liste1.pdf' file. Both were able to extract about the same information but in case of 'pypdf2' we get an iban in one row, while with 'pdfminer' we get the country id over some rows and after that the numbers belonging to the id. It would take way more time to extract the correct ibans using this text file.\n",
    "Another example of that behavior would be the 'flyers/bundeswehr.pdf' file. It is not really clear where which numbers belong to. While using the 'pypdf2' generated text file we can clearly observe a pattern which makes text analytics work later easier.\n",

    "Also, from an accuracy perspective it seems like the 'pypdf2' extraction is better.\n",
